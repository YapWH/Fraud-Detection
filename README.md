## Overview
The Online Transaction Fraud Detection system is a machine learning project designed to identify **fraudulent activities in online transactions**. It uses a combination of rule-based systems and anomaly detection algorithms in **Artificial Intelligence** to flag suspicious transactions for further review.

### Key Features
- **Real-time monitoring**: The system can monitor transactions in real-time to identify potential fraud.
- **Anomaly detection**: It uses advanced algorithms to detect anomalies that may indicate fraudulent behavior.
- **User-friendly interface**: A simple and intuitive user interface for non-technical users.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `Pytorch`, `PyQt5`, `torchvision`, etc.
- Or install from requirement: 
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirement.txt

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YapWH/Fraud-Detection.git

2. Open the folder and run the `MCYIC.py` file.
